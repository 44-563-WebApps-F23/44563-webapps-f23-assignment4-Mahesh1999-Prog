    <h1>Mahesh acts in a play</h1>
    <h6>an Enemy of the people BY Henrik Ibsen</h6>
    <p class="direction"><br>(SCENE.—The editorial office of the "People's Messenger." The entrance
        door is on the left-hand side of the back wall; on the right-hand side
        is another door with glass panels through which the printing room can
        be seen. Another door in the right-hand wall. In the middle of the room
        is a large table covered with papers, newspapers and books. In the
        foreground on the left a window, before which stands a desk and a high
        stool. There are a couple of easy chairs by the table, and other chairs
        standing along the wall. The room is dingy and uncomfortable; the
        furniture is old, the chairs stained and torn. In the printing room the
        compositors are seen at work, and a printer is working a handpress.
        HOVSTAD is sitting at the desk, writing. BILLING comes in from the
        right with DR. STOCKMANN'S manuscript in his hand.)</br></p>
        
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad (turning round).</h6><p class="speech">Hush!—Speak so that Aslaksen cannot hear you.
<h6 class="Billing">Billing (lowering his voice).</h6><p class="speech">Aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a
coward; there is nothing of the man in him. But this time you will
insist on your own way, won't you? You will put the Doctor's article in?</p>
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Yes, and if the Mayor doesn't like it—
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p class="speech">That will be the devil of a nuisance.</p>
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account,
whatever happens. If the Mayor will not fall in with the Doctor's
project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the whole of
the Householders' Association and the rest of them. And if he does fall
in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders
in the Baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p class="speech">Yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty
penny—</p>
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Yes, you may be sure they will. And in this way the ring will
be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will
enlighten the public on the Mayor's incapability on one point and
another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town,
the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of
the Liberals.
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p class="speech">That is perfectly true! I see it coming—I see it coming; we
are on the threshold of a revolution!</p>
<br>(A knock is heard at the door.)</br>
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Hush! (Calls out.) Come in! (DR. STOCKMANN comes in by the
street door. HOVSTAD goes to meet him.) Ah, it is you, Doctor! Well?
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">You may set to work and print it, Mr. Hovstad!</p>
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Has it come to that, then?
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p>Hurrah!</p>
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">Yes, print away. Undoubtedly it has come to that. Now
they must take what they get. There is going to be a fight in the town,
Mr. Billing!
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p class="speech">War to the knife, I hope! We will get our knives to their
throats, Doctor!</p>
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">This article is only a beginning. I have already got
four or five more sketched out in my head. Where is Aslaksen?</p>
<h6 class="Billing">Billing (calls into the printing-room).</h6><p class="speech">Aslaksen, just come here for a
minute!
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Four or five more articles, did you say? On the same subject?</p>
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">No—far from it, my dear fellow. No, they are about
quite another matter. But they all spring from the question of the
water supply and the drainage. One thing leads to another, you know. It
is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.
<h6 class="Billing">Billing.</h6><p class="speech">Upon my soul, it's true; you find you are not done till you
have pulled all the old rubbish down.</p>
<h6 class="Aslaksen">Aslaksen (coming in).</h6><p class="speech">Pulled down? You are not thinking of pulling down
the Baths surely, Doctor?
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">Far from it, don't be afraid.</p>
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">No, we meant something quite different. Well, what do
you think of my article, Mr. Hovstad?
<h6 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h6><p class="speech">I think it is simply a masterpiece.</p>
<h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">Do you really think so? Well, I am very pleased, very
pleased.</p>
